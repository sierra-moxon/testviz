The Biolink Model is a high-level data model designed to standardize types and relationships in biological knowledge
graphs, covering entities like genes, diseases, chemical substances, organisms, genomics, phenotypes, and more.
It is expressed as a YAML schema, which is then translated into various formats including OWL ontology, Python
dataclasses, and JSON schema. The model divides into entities, associations, and slots, where entities represent nodes
in a property graph, associations define edges with evidence and provenance, and slots are properties of nodes and
edges. It also includes a comprehensive list of CURIE prefix mappings and provides guidelines for using the model with
different graph representations like Neo4J and RDF. The goal of the Biolink Model is to provide a consistent framework
for representing biological knowledge across various databases and formats.
